    <h4>India national cricket team</h4>
    <p>
      The <strong>India men's national cricket team</strong>, also known as Team
      India or the Men in Blue,[10] represents India in men's international
      cricket. It is governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India
      (BCCI), and is a Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC)
      with Test,
      <b>One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status</b
      >. The most important reason i like is because of the thrill that we get
      from it. I have my idol Mr. M.S.Dhoni sir who plays for indian cricket
      team, that boosts my interest towards watching or playing cricket.
