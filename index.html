    <h4>India national cricket team</h4>
    <p>
      The <strong>India men's national cricket team</strong>, also known as Team
      India or the Men in Blue,[10] represents India in men's international
      cricket. It is governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India
      (BCCI), and is a Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC)
      with Test,
      <b>One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status</b
      >. The most important reason i like is because of the thrill that we get
      from it. I have my idol Mr. M.S.Dhoni sir who plays for indian cricket
      team, that boosts my interest towards watching or playing cricket.

    <h1>This is a Country Table</h1>
    <p>We are going to prepare a table that recommends countries that everyone should visit in their lifetime atleast once.
      Travelling means being constantly exposed to something newâ€¦ new people, new cultures, new locations, new ways of life, new languages, new realities and more. And if one is open to take that in without any judgment or prejudice, 
      it will certainly help you expand your horizons, grow your knowledge and understanding of the world and people.

    <h1>Jquery Code to validate Age</h1>
    <p>It turns out, that this type of form is a fairly easy one to validate, because all you need to do is 
      prove whether it's true or false that someone is older than the desired age cut off for access to your site. 
      The jQuery snippet you can use to validate this type of form is as follows:</p>
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18956956/validate-date-for-anyone-over-18-with-jquery"></a>
    <pre>
      $("#age-form").submit(function(){
      var day = $("#day").val();
      var month = $("#month").val();
      var year = $("#year").val();
      var age = 18;
      var mydate = new Date();
      mydate.setFullYear(year, month-1, day);
    
      var currdate = new Date();
      currdate.setFullYear(currdate.getFullYear() - age);
      if ((currdate - mydate) < 0){
        alert("Sorry, only persons over the age of " + age + " may enter this site");
        return false;
      }
      return true;
    });
  </pre>
